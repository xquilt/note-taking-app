Description

*   CLI note taking application written entirely in vanilla javascript .

TODO

- [ ] Adding either options or commands to the script , where options will theoretically will be more manageable , whereas commands might conflict with the additional note strings themselves . 
- [ ] Adding a database for saving the notes of the user , with some predefined place for saving these notes within the file system .
- [ ] The command line arguments would work just fine .
- [ ] It should support an additional interactive UI at a more advanced development phrase later on .
    -[ ] The interactive UI should contain a plethora of functionalities .

            -[ ] hierarchical structure of notes within categories . 
            -[ ] interactive usage with vi movement.
